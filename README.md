# HW4_RegistrarOfficeSim
Imagine that the registrarâ€™s office has approached you with the following issues. At certain times during the day students arrive in large numbers. If there are not enough windows open, the average student wait times are too long, and they receive many complaints. On the other hand, if they open too many windows, their staff will be idle for most of the time, and they will be wasting money. They want you to program a simulation that will allow them to calculate metrics on student wait times and window idle times given a specific traffic flow of students.


median wait time
number of windows idle over 5 minutes. we interpreted this as how many windows had a total idle time of over 5 minutes, not when it is continuous 5 minutes
